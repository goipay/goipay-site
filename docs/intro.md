# Welcome to GoiPay

GoiPay is a lightweight cryptocurrency payment processor microservice, written in Golang, designed for creating and processing cryptocurrency invoices via gRPC.

It was built as a service-to-service solution with limited functionality, primarily focusing on the basic features described above, so you can easily integrate it into your own projects.

## Key Features

- **Self-hosted**: Run it on your own infrastructure
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource requirements (does not rely on the wallet RPC)
- **Multi-currency**: Support for multiple cryptocurrencies (coming soon)
- **Multi-user**: Support for multiple users
