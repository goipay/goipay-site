## Important Note on Data Fetching

GoiPay does not provide gRPC services for fetching data. For data access and querying, you should use external tools or services. We recommend using solutions like [PostGraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/introduction/), [jOOQ](https://www.jooq.org/), or other database querying tools that fit your technology stack.

These external tools are optimized for handling complex queries, providing better flexibility and performance for your application.
